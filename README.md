# Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project, **Student Performance Prediction**, uses machine learning to predict students' grades and provide personalized academic insights. By analyzing key performance indicators such as attendance, historical grades, and participation, the system generates customized study plans and actionable insights to help students improve their academic outcomes.

## Key Features
- **Prediction of Student Grades**: Uses machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, Linear Regression, and Neural Networks to predict student performance.
- **Personalized Study Plans**: Generates customized study plans based on student goals and current performance data.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback on mock tests, helping students identify areas for improvement.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualizes student progress with detailed reports and performance graphs.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
1. **Decision Trees**: For interpretable predictions of student grades.
2. **Random Forests**: Achieves high accuracy by leveraging ensemble learning.
3. **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous grade values based on linear relationships.
4. **Neural Networks**: Handles complex patterns for high-accuracy predictions.

## Technologies Used
### Backend
- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Flask**: For the web application backend.
- **Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy**: For machine learning and data manipulation.
  
### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS**: For the user interface design.
  
### Libraries for Visualization
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For generating performance graphs and visual reports.

## Project Structure
1. **Student Data Input**: Collects and validates student data such as attendance, historical grades, and participation.
2. **Performance Analysis**: Predicts student grades and visualizes academic performance.
3. **Target Setting**: Allows students to set academic goals and receive tailored study plans.
4. **Mock Tests and Feedback**: Students can take practice tests and receive immediate feedback on their performance.
5. **Progress Tracking**: Displays academic progress over time, with detailed graphs and reports.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git
 
2. Install the required dependencies:
  
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
3. Run the application:
